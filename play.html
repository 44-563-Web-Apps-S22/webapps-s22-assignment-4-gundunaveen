        <h2>Tartuffe or The Hypocrite</h2>

        <h4>ACT IV: Scene 3
            Orgon, Elmire, Mariane, Cleante, Dorine</h4>

            <h5>Orgon</h5>  
            <p>See?</p>

            <h5>Elmire</h5>
            <p>Yes.</p>
            
            <h5>Orgon</h5>
            <p>Fantasy!</p>

            <h5>Elmire</h5>
            <p> But if I found a way. To make you see it all in light of day?</p>

            <h5>Orgon</h5>
            <p>Fairy tales!</p>

            <h5>Elmire</h5>
            <p>What a man!  At least reprely.
                I don't ask you to believe me, but I
                Do wonder what you will say of your good man
                If I bring you to a place where you can
                Clearly see and hear these things?  What then?</p>

            <h5>Orgon</h5>
            <p>In that case I would say . . . nothing again,
                For it cannot be.</p>
