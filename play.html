        <h2>Tartuffe or The Hypocrite</h2>

        <h4>ACT IV: Scene 3
            Orgon, Elmire, Mariane, Cleante, Dorine</h4>

            <pre>Orgon.  See?
                Elmire.       Yes.
                Orgon.             Fantasy!
                Elmire.                       But if I found a way
                        To make you see it all in light of day?
                Orgon.  Fairy tales!
                Elmire.                 What a man!  At least reprely.
                        I don't ask you to believe me, but I
                        Do wonder what you will say of your good man
                        If I bring you to a place where you can
                        Clearly see and hear these things?  What then?
                Orgon.  In that case I would say . . . nothing again,
                        For it cannot be.</pre>
